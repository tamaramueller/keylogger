# keylogger
A Python Keylogger, saving the timestamp and the pressed key.

(1) Preferably create a virtual environment with Python 3. Then run 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to install all packages. 

(2) Then simply start the keylogger with the following command:

```
python keylogger.py
```

The keylogger will run in the background and record all pressed keys.
